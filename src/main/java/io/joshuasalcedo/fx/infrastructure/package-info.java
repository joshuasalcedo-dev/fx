/**
 * This package contains infrastructure components that support the application.
 *
 * <p>The infrastructure layer provides technical capabilities to the application, including
 * configuration, persistence, external integrations, and other technical concerns. It implements

 * services.

 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Spring configuration classes and bean definitions
 *   <li>Repository implementations for data access
 *   <li>External service integrations and adapters
 *   <li>Security configuration and implementation
 *   <li>Technical utilities and infrastructure services
 *   <li>Database configuration and migration scripts
 * </ul>
