/**
 * This package contains the presentation layer components of the application.
 *
 * <p>The presentation layer is responsible for handling interface concerns and user interactions.
 * It includes controllers, DTOs, and related utilities that present information to the user and
 * interpret user commands.
 *
 * <p>Key components in this package include:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Controllers that handle user interactions
 *   <li>Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) for API responses
 *   <li>Request objects for API inputs
 *   <li>View models that adapt domain models for presentation
 *   <li>API-specific utilities and helper classes
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>This package follows a clean separation of concerns, keeping presentation logic separate from
 * business logic. It communicates with the application layer to execute business operations and
 * retrieve data for display.
 *
 * @since 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT
