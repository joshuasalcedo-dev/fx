/**
 * This package contains the presentation layer components of the application.
 * 
 * <p>The presentation layer is responsible for handling interface concerns and
 * user interactions. It includes controllers, DTOs, and related utilities
 * that present information to the user and interpret user commands.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Key components in this package include:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Controllers that handle user interactions</li>
 *   <li>Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) for API responses</li>
 *   <li>Request objects for API inputs</li>
 *   <li>View models that adapt domain models for presentation</li>
 *   <li>API-specific utilities and helper classes</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>This package follows a clean separation of concerns, keeping presentation logic
 * separate from business logic. It communicates with the application layer to 
 * execute business operations and retrieve data for display.</p>
 * 
 * @since 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT
